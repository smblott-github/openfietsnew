OpenFietsNew
------------

This is a tweaked version of [OpenFietsmap](http://www.openfietsmap.nl/).  All
credit goes there.

Some of the differences are:

- Use grey instead of an unfortunate orange for residential areas (to make streets stand out).
- Make drinking water and campsites visible at lower zoom levels.
- Various other tweaks make some features less prominent.
